## ❓ What is it?

**Heavi's Python Obfuscator** is a powerful, lightweight tool for turning clean Python code into a tangled mess of hard-to-read logic — without breaking functionality.

---

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Variable renaming with random, unguessable names  
- ✅ Control flow flattening  
- ✅ Base64 payload encoding  
- ✅ `exec()` and dynamic evaluation tricks  
- ✅ Anti-debugger checks (`sys.gettrace()`)  
- ✅ Random junk code injection (NOP-style lambdas, fake logic)
- ✅ Doesn't trigger false-positives on antiviruses like many other obfuscators (A.K.A, your non-malicious code will not be flagged as malicious)

## ⚙️ Usage

Make a file named code.py with your code you want to be obfuscated in the directory.
Then, run the obfuscator.py
This will output obfuscated.py
